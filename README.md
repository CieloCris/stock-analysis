# Green Stock Analysis using VBA
 
## Overview

#### The parents of our client, Steve, want to invest in green energy stock, especially in DAQO. Because of this, Steve asked us to do a dataset analysis to identify the market performance of green stocks. We used excel and VBA, with which we created a macro that allowed us to facilitate the analysis and data visualization so that Steve can make the best recommendations to his parents.
### However, once we programmed our VBA script, the newest challenge is to improve the macro.

## Purpose
#### Our purpose is to refactor and improve the VBA code so it can run faster. That is, our goal is to refactor the macro to make it more efficient.

## Results
#### Previously, our code for green energy stocks analysis used nested loops to report data from 2017 and 2018 sheets. Below are the images of the results and the time it took to run the macro.

#### Through the revision and refactoring of the code, it was possible to improve the code and reduce time.

## Summary

## Advantages a Disadvantages of refactoring code in general
### Advantages:
#### -Refactoring code teaches us that in programming there are many ways to solve problems. It's always important to find the most efficient solution.
#### -Improving the code helps to reduce time.
#### -Refactoring is fundamental to making the code more efficient because it looks cleaner and more structured.
### Disadvantages:
#### -Code refactoring requires a lot of time, effort, and understanding.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
#### -Advantages: Although the code worked in its old version, after refactoring, the macro could run faster. So, we can conclude that improving the code helps to reduce the time in which the macros run.
#### -Disadvantages: It's hard to find ways to refactor VBA scripts because it requires experience and patience.

## Recommendation for our client:
#### The analysis of the dataset shows the performance of the green stocks during 2017 and 2018. In the first year of study (2017), we overall observed good performance on green energy stocks; while in the next year (2018) the performance worsened for most companies.
#### We conclude that investing in DAQO is not recommended, so we suggest Steve update the dataset and replicate the analysis before deciding where to invest.
